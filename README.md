Youâ€™ve been asked by your CEO to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data.

# Objectives
The goals for this challenge are for you to:

- Use Pandas functions like groupby, pivot, resample, and reset_index on a DataFrame.
- Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
- Create a new DataFrame from multiple groupby() Series.
- Format columns of a DataFrame.
- Create a multiple-line graph.
- Annotate and apply styling to the chart.

## Resources
